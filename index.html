    <P>My first week was both sad and happy for me. Happy because I had enrolled into a school to learn tech and sad because I would not see my family and friends for months. I was a little homesick. I got to meet new people from different countries and was able to know a little more about their different cultures.
    </P>

    <p>We signed contracts and read a handbook and safeguarding policy. Later we were asked to act out the different scenarios in our safeguarding policy in order for us to understand better. This was a very new experience for me.

        Being a diverse campus, we were able to taste new food which was interesting to me. I got to taste injera and beso (Ethiopian foods).

        The campus team members were introduced to us. They helped us to get acquainted with the campus routine as well as different duties and activities. We were assigned classes where we were able to meet our classmates.

        The first week was not very busy, I took some  time to explore the campus; discovering different spots, getting to know their names and what activities take place in them. I got to see the classes, the Kaya and the garden which I felt would be a place that I would spend most of my breaks.
